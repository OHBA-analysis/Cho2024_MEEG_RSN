# Data Descriptions

## ðŸ”Ž Overview

In this directory, you can find (1) a list of model hyperparameters, (2) an inferred transition probability matrix, and (3) model weights of two HMM models.

The HMM model trained on the EEG LEMON data can be found in [`trained_model_eeg`](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/Cho2024_MEEG_RSN/tree/main/data/trained_model_eeg), 
and the one trained on the MEG Cam-CAN data can be found in [`trained_model_meg`](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/Cho2024_MEEG_RSN/tree/main/data/trained_model_meg).

For instructions on loading a specific HMM model and retrieving model inferences, refer to `example.py`.
